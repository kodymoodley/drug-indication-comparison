# Drug Indications Portal

An effort to compare the ontology terms representing drug indications on [DrugCentral](http://drugcentral.org/) to that of [DailyMed](http:/dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/) which is being actively annotated with ontology terms and extra contextual information about drug usage, using the [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is/) web annotator.

Access the current version of the portal [here](http://fhssrvvm0015.fhs.unimaas.nl/drugindications/IndicationCodesExtractor.php).
