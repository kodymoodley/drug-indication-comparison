This directory contains a number sample files that demonstrate various
aspects of the UMLS::Similarity package and related utilities.

We recommend that you save a copy of the files in this directory for 
future use.  

Configuration Files
===================

pathmeasures.config: is a sample configuration file for the umls-similarity.pl 
program in the utils/ directory when using the path-based measures

icmeasures.config  : is a sample configuration file for the umls-similarity.pl 
program in the utils/ directory when using the information content measures

vector.config      : is a sample configuration file for the umls-similarity.pl 
program in the utils/ directory when using the vector vector measure

lesk.config        : is a sample configuration file for the umls-similarity.pl 
program in the utils/ directory when using the vector lesk measure

Information Content
===================

icpropagation: is a sample file containing a list of CUIs and their 
information content This file is required by the umls-similarity.pl
program when using the information content measures. 

icfrequency: is a sample file containing a list of CUIs and their 
frequency. This file is required by the createPropagationFile.pl 
which uses these frequency counts to generate an icpropagation file. 
It also can be used by umls-similarity if you would like to generate 
the information content on the fly for a given input.


Vector Files
===================

vectormatrix: is a sample of the matrix file required when using the 
vector measure.

vectorindex : is a sample of the index file required when using the 
vector measure.

dictfile    : is a sample of the dictionary file that can be used instead 
of having the definitions be obtained from the UMLS.


stoplist-nsp.regex
==================
 
stoplist-nsp.regex : is a sample of the stop words for lesk and vector 
method. Stop words are in the regular expression format.
