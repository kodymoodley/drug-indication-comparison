WordNet::Similarity Web Interface
=================================

The web interface distribution contains two CGI scripts, which are in the
cgi-bin directory:

cgi-bin/umls_similarity.cgi
cgi-bin/umls_wps.cgi

A set of required html and style files in the docs directory:

docs/faq.html       
docs/index.html
docs/instructions.html  
docs/similarity_measures.html
docs/relatedness_measures.html  
docs/logo_black.gif     
docs/sim-style.css

As well as two directories containing the externam information content 
and vector files, also in the docs directory:

docs/icpropagation  
docs/vectorfiles

The code and documentation borrows heavly from the WordNet::Similarity 
web interface written by Jason Michelizzi if you are familiar with it. 
Any problems with this package though are due to my inabilities not 
Jason's. All good things with this package are due to his very nice 
coding and documention skills. 
 
The interface employs a client-server model.  The two CGI scripts,
umls_similarity.cgi and umls)wps.cgi, are the clients that request 
informationfrom the similarity server (umls_similarity_server.pl). 
The similarityserver is distributed as one of the utilities (in the 
/utils directory)in this package.

The similarity server is a network interface to the UMLS::Similarity
measures. It is similarity_server.pl that actually interacts with the 
UMLS-Interface and UMLS-Similarity packages to compute relatedness 
scores. It loads all the similarity modules, and sits on a machine 
listening for network requests for relatedness information. A client 
can then connect to this similarity server and request information 
about semantic relatedness of words and concepts. This information, 
if available, will be returned by the similarity server to the client 
over the netwrok connection.

In the web interface, umls_similarity.cgi and umls_wps.cgi are the 
clients thatconnect to the similarity server to request similarity 
or relatedness information. The information retrieved by these two 
clients from the server is then presented via web-pages to the end-user. 
Thus, umls_wps.cgi and umls_similarity.cgi form part of the web-server 
creating web pages to serve up to the end-user, using information 
obtained from the backend similarity server (umls_similarity_server.pl). 
Here is a block schematic:


[UMLS Similarity Server] <-----> [Web Server] <-----> [End User]
                             (umls_similarity.cgi)     (browser)
                             (umls_wps.cgi)


The umsl_similarity_server.pl can be run on the same machine on which your
webserver is running or it can be on a different machine.  Running the 
umls_similarity_server.pl on a different machine than the webserver can 
beuseful if you have only limited control over the webserver machine (for
example, you might not be able to install WordNet on the webserver
machine).

Quick Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

This guide assumes that you are using the Apache webserver as installed
on a Fedora/RedHat based Linux distribution. If you are using a 
different server or Linux distribution, then the setup process will 
probably vary a little.

Step 1
------
Put the umls_similarity.cgi and umls_wps.cgi scripts whereever CGI scripts 
go on your webserver (e.g., /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin). In order to keep 
your system somewhat organized, you may want to put them in a subdirectory 
in your cgi directory (e.g., /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/umls_similarity). 
These  instructions generally assume the latter.  

The various html, style sheets, and images in the 'docs' directory  
of the distribution. These should be put wherever html documents go on  
your webserver (e.g., /usr/local/apache2/htdocs). In order to keep your  
system somewhat organized, you may want to put them in a subdirectory in  
your html directory (e.g., /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/umls_similarity). 
These instructions generally assume the latter. 

The icpropagation and vectorfiles directories in the 'docs' directory
should also be put wherever the html documents go on your server. 

Note that if you are using Ubuntu Linux, your cgi-bin directory is 
typically found at /usr/lib/cgi-bin and documents are found in /var/www

Step 2
------

The following three files may need to be edited:

umls_similarity.cgi
umls_wps.cgi
umls_similarity_server.pl


- umls_similarity.cgi
   * change $remote_host to be the hostname or IP addr of the machine
     on which similarty_server.pl is located.  If umls_similarity_server.pl 
     is running on the same machine as your web server, then 'localhost' 
     or '127.0.0.1' will work.  Note: the setting for $remote_host and
     $remote_port in similarity.cgi are not related to Apache's LISTEN
     setting.  In fact, $remote_port needs to be different than the
     port on which Apache is listening.

   * set $doc_base to be the relative path to the HTML files that are
     in the 'doc' directory in the distribution. For example, if you
     have the .cgi files in /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/umls_similarity 
     and the HTML files in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/umls_similarity, 
     then you  would set $doc_base to '../../umls_similarity'.  Note: 
     this  variable is not (closely) related to Apache's DOCUMENT_ROOT 
     setting.

- umls_wps.cgi
   * $remote_host should be the same as $remote_host for umls_similarity.cgi. 
     $doc_base is the location of a style sheet (sim-style.css), which
     is often the same as $doc_base in umls_similarity.cgi. 

-umls_similarity_server.pl
   * $doc_base is the location of a style sheet (sim-style.css), which
     is the same as $doc_base in umls_similarity.cgi. The reason is 
     because the directories containing required files for the icpropagation 
     and vector measure files are in the same directory. 

Step 3
------
Start umls_similarity_server.pl, by running:

$ umls_similarity_server.pl

A number of options are available for running the server. Please see the
documentation of umls_similarity_server.pl for more information on this. 
This utility should be installed along with all the other utilities as 
part of the installation of the UMLS::Similarity package.
