    <h1>Similarity Measures</h1>

    <h2>Path length</h2>
    <p>A simple node-counting scheme (path).  The similarity score is inversely
      proportional to the number of nodes along the shortest path between
      the concepts.  The shortest possible path occurs when the two concepts
      are the same, in which case the length is 1.  Thus, the maximum
      similarity value is 1.
    </p>

    <h2>Leacock &amp; Chodorow</h2>
    <p>The similarity measure proposed by Leacock and Chodorow (lch) is
      -log (length / (2 * D)), where length is the length of the shortest
      path between the two concepts (using node-counting) and D is the
      maximum depth of the taxonomy.
    </p>

    <h2>Wu &amp; Palmer</h2>
    <p>The Wu & Palmer measure (wup) calculates similarity by considering the
       depths of the two concepts in the UMLS, along with the depth of the LCS
       The formula is score = 2*depth(lcs) / (depth(s1) + depth(s2)).  This 
       means that 0 &lt; score &lt;= 1.  The score can never be zero because 
       the depth of the LCS is never zero (the depth of the root of a taxonomy 
       is one). The score is one if the two input concepts are the same.
    </p>

   <h2>Resnik</h2>
   <p>The related value is equal to the information content (IC) of the
      Least Common Subsumer (LCS) (most informative subsumer).  This means
      that the value will always be greater-than or equal-to zero.  The
      upper bound on the value is generally quite large and varies depending
      upon the size of the corpus used to determine information content values.
      To be precise, the upper bound should be ln (N) where N is the number of
      words in the corpus.</p>

    <h2>Jiang &amp; Conrath</h2>
    <p>The similarity value returned by the jcn measure is equal to
       1 / jcn_distance, where jcn_distance is equal to
      IC(concept1) + IC(concept2) - 2 * IC(lcs).
    </p>
    <p>There are two special cases that need to be handled carefully when
      computing similarity; both of these involve the case when jcn_distance
      is zero.
    </p>
    <p>In the first case, we have ic(concept1) = ic(concept2) = ic(lcs) = 0.
      In an ideal world, this would only happen when all three concepts,
      viz. concept1, concept2, and lcs, are the root node. However, when a
      concept has a frequency count of zero, we use the value 0 for the
      information content. In this first case, we return 0 due to lack of
      data.
    </p>
    <p>In the second case, we have ic(concept1) + ic(concept2) = 2 * ic(ics).
      This is almost always found when concept1 = concept2 = lcs (i.e., the
      two input concepts are the same). Intuitively this is the case of
      maximum similarity, which would be infinity, but it is impossible
      to return infinity. Insteady we find the smallest possible distance
      greater than zero and return the multiplicative inverse of that distance.
    </p>

    <h2>Lin</h2>
    <p>The similarity value returned by the lin measure is a number equal
      to 2 * IC(lcs) / (IC(concept1) + IC(concept2)). Where IC(x) is the
      information content of x. One can observe, then, that the similarity
      value will be greater-than or equal-to zero and less-than or equal-to
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the information content of any of either concept1 or concept2 is zero,
      then zero is returned as the similarity score, due to lack of data.
      Ideally, the information content of a concept would be zero only if
      that concept were the root node, but when the frequency of a concept 
      is zero, we use the value of zero as the information content because
      of a lack of better alternatives.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual Distance</h2>
    <p>The similarity value returned by the cdist measure is the number of 
      edges between two concepts in the UMLS. This was initial proposed by 
      Rada, et. al. using the RB/RN relations in the UMLS and later evaluated 
      by Caviedes and Cimino using the PAR/CHD relations. 
    </p>
    <h2> Nguyen and Al-Mubaid</h2>
    <p>The similarity value returned by the nam measure is computed by 
      calculating the log of two plus the product of the shortest distance 
      between the two concepts minus one and the depth of the taxonomy minus 
      the depth of the LCS. Concepts that are more similar with have a lower 
      similarity score than concepts that are less similar with this measure.
    </p>
    <h2>Random</h2>
    <p>The similarity values are simply randomly generated numbers. 
     This is intended only to be used as a baseline.
