    <h1>What is the difference between similarity and relatedness?</h1>

    <p>Semantic similarity measures quantify how ``alike'' (or similar)  
      two concepts are by determining their closeness in a hierarchy. 
      Semantic relatedness measures quantify degree of semantic feature 
      overlap between two terms. Two terms may be related (needle-thread) 
      but not necessarily similar.

    <h1>What is a Concept Unique Identifier?</h1>

    <p>
      In simple terms, a Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) is a concept in the 
      UMLS Metathesaurus. 
      
      For a longer explanation, read on:

      The UMLS Metathesaurus contains biomedical and clinical concepts
      from over 100 disparate terminology sources that have been semi-
      automatically integrated into a single resource containing a wide 
      range of biomedical and clinical information. For example, it contains 
      the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), 
      which is a comprehensive clinical terminology created for the electronic 
      exchange of clinical health information, the Foundational Model of Anatomy 
      (FMA), which is an ontology of anatomical concepts created specifically for 
      biomedical and clinical research, and MEDLINEPLUS, which is a terminology 
      source containing health related concepts created specifically for consumers 
      of health services. 

      The concepts in these sources can overlap. For example, the concept 
      Autonomic nerve exists in both SNOMED CT and FMA. The Metathesaurus 
      assigns the synonymous concepts from the various sources a CUI. Thus 
      both the Autonomic nerve concepts in SNOMED CT and FMA are assigned 
      the same CUI (C0206250). This allows multiple sources in the 
      Metathesaurus to be treated as a single resource.
