UMLS-Similarity
    This package consists of Perl modules along with supporting Perl
    programs that implement the semantic similarity and relatedness measures
    described by Leacock & Chodorow (1998), Wu & Palmer (1994), Nguyen and
    Al-Mubaid (2006), Rada, et. al. 1989, Patwardhan (2003), Jiang & Conrath
    (1997), Resnik (1995), Lin (1998), Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) and a
    simple path based measure.

TESTING PLATFORMS
    UMLS-Similarity has been developed and tested on Linux and Solaris,
    primarily using Perl and the C shell (csh).

    UMLS-Similarity REQUIRES that the following software be installed. More
    details on how to obtain and install appear below.

    --Programming Languages Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)

    	   	   Text::NSP
                   File::Spec
                   File::Path
                   Lingua::Stem
		   Text::OverlapFinder

INSTALLATION
    If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local
    install, you can install via:

     perl -MCPAN -e shell
     > install UMLS-Similarity

    If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,
    unpacking, and executing the following commands.

                    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs LIB=/home/lib
                    make
                    make test
                    make install

    Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you
    create a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access.

    You must include /home/lib in your PERL5LIB environment variable to
    access this module when running.

    If you have the super-user access, then you can install UMLS-Similarity
    into system directories via : perl Makefile.PL make make install make
    clean

    The exact location of where UMLS-Similarity will be installed depends on
    your system configuration. A message will be printed out after 'make
    install' telling your exactly where it was installed.
