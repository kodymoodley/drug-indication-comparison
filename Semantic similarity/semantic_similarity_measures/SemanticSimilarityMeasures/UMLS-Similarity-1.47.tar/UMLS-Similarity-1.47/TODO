NAME
    Todo List for UMLS-Similarity

SYNOPSIS
    Plans for future versions of UMLS-Similarity

TO DO LIST
    1. Add configuration information to the cache files.

    2. Add option such that after the shortest path between the two concepts
    is of a certain threshold just return a similarity score of zero. There
    is something similar to this in WordNet:: Similarity. I think this would
    be very useful when using the --realtime option

    3. Explore using measures of association rather than frequency in the
    vectors for the vector measure

    4. Explore linking WordNet and the UMLS together outside of the --dict
    file option for the relatedness measures

    5. Add additional defaults for the icpropgation and vector matrix files.
    Right now vector matrix comes from clinical records, I think we should
    explore using the bigrams over the entire Medline provided by NLM. The
    bigram files is large and therefore thresholds here become really
    important otherwise we get killed on time.
